# Changelog

## 1.2.0 — comparison and laptop-hardening revision

### Added

- Corporate proxy and CA staging for Bash and PowerShell without disabling TLS verification.
- Purpose-specific application and MCP Docker images.
- Exact split requirement sets and target-laptop installed-version checks.
- Strict MCP compatibility profile with fail-fast profile/version/statelessness validation.
- MCP service runtime-version reporting and exact image-pin verification.
- Restart-stable action and approval identifiers derived from durable case state.
- Replay-safe evidence, action, timeline, work-order and MR histories.
- Parent/child SLA authority while preserving the child clock.
- Safe next-best-action override that returns through policy for a fresh approval.
- Configurable Streamlit fragment refresh.
- PostgreSQL workflow-service recreation and same-thread resume test.
- `hfc_failed_plant_action_rerca` scenario demonstrating re-RCA and same-MR update after a failed plant action.
- Expanded comparison, test, runbook and workflow documentation.

### Preserved

- Six-page Streamlit operations console.
- FastAPI query and command API.
- Portable workflow plus LangGraph wrapper.
- Network HTTP MCP path for live execution.
- Fake, OpenAI and Anthropic assistant adapters.
- Signed human approvals and persistent effect idempotency.
- Clean Boots, Dirty Boots, HFC tap, PON ODP, jTrack MR and reverse-handover behavior.

### Verification performed during packaging

- 35 automated tests passed.
- 84.63% measured source coverage.
- Nine-scenario matrix passed.
- Compose structural validation passed.
- Python and Bash syntax validation passed.
- Separate-process FastAPI-to-HTTP-MCP workflow passed using the portable engine.

Docker, pinned LangGraph/Streamlit runtime and PostgreSQL checkpoint recreation must be verified on the target laptop with `scripts/verify_docker.sh` or `scripts/verify_docker.ps1`.
